Fall detection is a critical aspect of ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals, particularly the elderly and those with medical conditions prone to falls. The concept of fall detection is introduced, emphasizing its importance in healthcare and elderly care settings. Falls are a significant health risk, often leading to serious injuries and complications, making timely detection imperative for prompt medical assistance. This research paper presents a novel approach to real-time human fall detection utilizing rule-based techniques. The proposed approach relies on rule-based techniques for fall detection. Unlike traditional methods that often require complex algorithms and expensive hardware, our system utilizes a set of predefined rules derived from extensive observation and analysis of human fall behaviors. These rules encapsulate various parameters such as body orientation, velocity, and acceleration to accurately identify falls in real-time. The effectiveness of the developed system is demonstrated through rigorous testing, achieving a remarkable accuracy rate of 90%. This high level of accuracy is attributed to the robustness of the rule-based approach, which allows for efficient detection of falls while minimizing false alarms.

The primary objectives of human fall detection technology are as follows:
<br>
â€¢ To develop a Fall detection system that can track and monitor a user's activities and  
  providing insights into their progress and helping them to provide the real time falls.
<br>
â€¢ To develop a fall detction system that can provide correct falls and check whether the 
   fall is correct or wrong according to  individual user's activity.
<br>
â€¢ To develop a fall detction system that can identify correct and incorrect falls and sound
   a Alarm on coorect falls , helping to prevent injuries and improve overall form.
<br>
â€¢ To develop a fall detection system that used help old people with disabilities who may falls
   and can't able to stand and in emergency cases also.
<br>
â€¢ Overall, fall detction system  has the potential to revolutionize the way to prevent from more damage to 
   people by applying alaram on time, it making it more effective, accessible, and enjoyable for everyone.
