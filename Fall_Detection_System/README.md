# Fall-Detection-System

Welcome! This repository contains all of the code, notebooks, images and other materials related to the projects
If you'd like to see anything in particular, please send me an email: nk7003361@gmail.com or leave an issue.

Fall Detection is now widely explored in many application contexts, 
ranging from content-based retrieval, surveillance, indoor and outdoor monitoring, 
virtual reality until animation and entertainment. In particular, we are interested in 
human posture detection in the framework of home-human interface.

The primary objectives of human fall detection technology are as follows:
<br>
• To develop a Fall detection system that can track and monitor a user's activities and  
  providing insights into their progress and helping them to provide the real time falls.
<br>
• To develop a fall detction system that can provide correct falls and check whether the 
   fall is correct or wrong according to  individual user's activity.
<br>
• To develop a fall detction system that can identify correct and incorrect falls and sound
   a Alarm on coorect falls , helping to prevent injuries and improve overall form.
<br>
• To develop a fall detection system that used help old people with disabilities who may falls
   and can't able to stand and in emergency cases also.
<br>
• Overall, fall detction system  has the potential to revolutionize the way to prevent from more damage to 
   people by applying alaram on time, it making it more effective, accessible, and enjoyable for everyone.
