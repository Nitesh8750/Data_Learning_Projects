The Smart CCTV Surveillance System with Telegram Bot is a modern security solution designed to enhance monitoring efficiency and provide real-time updates. This system combines advanced computer vision techniques with the convenience of Telegram's messaging platform to create an interactive and responsive surveillance tool. By analyzing live video feeds, it identifies unauthorized individuals and sends instant alerts to the user via Telegram. Users can validate these alerts, and if a detected person is known, they can be added to the authorized database through the bot. This dynamic approach ensures that alerts are meaningful while minimizing unnecessary notifications. With features like facial recognition, automated decision-making, and user feedback integration, this system offers a personalized and scalable security solution for homes, offices, and other establishments.

OBJECTIVES:-
The primary objective of the Smart CCTV Surveillance System with Telegram Bot is to develop an intelligent, user-friendly, and automated monitoring solution that ensures enhanced security and minimizes manual intervention. This system is designed to achieve the following specific goals:

•	To capture and analyze images from CCTV cameras in real-time, identifying whether the individual is a family member or an unknown person using pre-trained image datasets.
•	To instantly send notifications via a Telegram bot when an unrecognized person is detected, ensuring timely alerts to the user.
•	To allow the user to confirm if an unknown person is actually known or authorized. This interaction via Telegram will enable the system to update the database dynamically with new entries.
