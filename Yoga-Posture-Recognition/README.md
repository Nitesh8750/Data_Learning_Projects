Human posture detection is now widely explored in many application contexts, 
ranging from content-based retrieval, surveillance, indoor and outdoor monitoring, 
virtual reality until animation and entertainment. In particular, we are interested in 
human posture detection in the framework of home-human interface.

The primary objectives of human posture recognition technology are as follows:
<br>
â€¢ To develop a Yoga posture recognition that can track and monitor a user's yoga practice, 
  providing insights into their progress and helping them to set and achieve fitness goals.
<br>
â€¢ To develop a Yoga posture recognition system that can provide personalized yoga 
  instruction, tailoring the poses and sequences to the individual user's needs and goals.
<br>
â€¢ To develop a Yoga posture recognition that can identify incorrect yoga poses and provide 
  guidance on how to correct them, helping to prevent injuries and improve overall form.
<br>
â€¢ To develop a Yoga posture recognition that used to make yoga accessible to people with 
  disabilities who may have difficulty seeing or performing poses correctly.
<br>
â€¢ Overall, yoga posture recognition has the potential to revolutionize the way people practice 
  yoga, making it more effective, accessible, and enjoyable for everyone.
